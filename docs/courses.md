One of our goals is to develop courses, workshops and trainings that can be easily accessed and used by community language workers and interested others.

## Available Now

Currently under development, but available for use is:

- [Introduction to Database Design](https://ailt.arizona.edu/courses/intro-to-databases/){.internal-link target="_blank"}.

We offered a portion of this material as a four-day workshop at [CoLang2024](https://www.colang2024.org/){.external-link target="_blank"}: 

- [Basics of Database Design](https://ailt.arizona.edu/courses/intro-to-databases/colang/){.internal-link target="_blank"}.

We have developed in-person workshops in a variety of other topics, please contact [Amy](mailto:avf@arizona.edu) for more information on these!

## Requested So Far

We have so far received and are triaging the following workshop requests:
